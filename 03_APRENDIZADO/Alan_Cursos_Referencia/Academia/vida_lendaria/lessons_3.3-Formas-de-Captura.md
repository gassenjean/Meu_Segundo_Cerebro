Com tanta informação disponível na ponta dos dedos hoje, acho que a maioria de nós tem a mesma resposta que estamos sobrecarregados. Experimentamos sobrecarga de informações. Como podemos acompanhar tudo o que encontramos? Bem, não devemos.

Não há necessidade de capturar cada pedacinho de informação que você consome, em vez disso, tenha a mentalidade de um curador. Nesta unidade, vou te ensinar como se afastar do dilúvio de informações que vem em seu caminho e como ser intencional com seu processo de captura. Você aprenderá a construir seu próprio banco de conhecimento, onde você só captura informações quando elas ressoam com você.

A ideia de um banco de conhecimento, na verdade, não é nova. Durante séculos, artistas e intelectuais de Leonardo DA Vinci a Virginia Wolf mantiveram o que foi chamado de um common placebook (livro comum). Tratava-se de um caderno onde guardavam trechos de outros livros e fontes, decompondo ideias em fragmentos e remontando-as em novos padrões que viam de sua própria perspectiva.

Esses bancos de conhecimento os ajudaram a entender um mundo em rápida mudança e serviram como um lugar confiável para informar sua escrita, sua fala e conversa. Avance rápido até hoje. Temos vidas multifacetadas, complexas e ricas em oportunidades.

Em outras palavras, todos nós poderíamos usar nosso próprio banco de conhecimento. Não é mais um luxo da elite intelectual, é uma necessidade do dia a dia. Mas o que é exatamente conhecimento? Na construção de um segundo cérebro, definimos conhecimento como conteúdo proveniente do mundo externo ou de seus pensamentos internos.

Alguns exemplos de conhecimento externo são destaques de artigos, citações, livros, memorandos de voz, notas de reunião e imagens. E alguns exemplos de seu conhecimento interno incluem faíscas de insight que você pensa durante seu dia, histórias, memórias, reflexões e reflexões. A beleza de um banco de conhecimento é que ele permite que você acesse e revise suas ideias e insights sempre que precisar deles em sua vida pessoal e profissional.

Veja como começar a criar um banco de conhecimento. O primeiro passo é escolher os dois ou três tipos de conteúdo das duas listas. Lembre-se do conhecimento externo e do conhecimento interno que você já tem o máximo e já valoriza.

Você tende a tomar muitas anotações de reunião? Você marca muitos artigos? Você se pega refletindo sobre suas ideias e insights? Identifique com frequência os tipos de conteúdo que são mais relevantes para você e comece por aí. Então, ao longo do seu dia a dia, sempre que encontrar esse tipo de conteúdo, observe se ele ressoa com você. Em caso afirmativo, pare imediatamente e capture essa informação na sua aplicação Notetakeing.

É isso. Não pense muito nisso quando estiver começando. Basta criar uma nova nota, adicionar seus pensamentos e clicar em salvar.

O que estamos desenvolvendo agora é seu hábito de captura, sua consciência e capacidade de perceber o que ressoa com você e aproveitar esse breve momento para anotá-lo em seu aplicativo de anotações. Com o tempo, seu banco de conhecimento se agrega e se torna um recurso inestimável. Ele permitirá que você conecte os pontos entre ideias e insights aparentemente díspares e se baseie em seu próprio conhecimento para informar suas decisões e ações.

Ao criar um banco de conhecimento, você está investindo em seu próprio desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional e se preparando para o sucesso a longo prazo. Você fecha.

Agora que sabemos por que estamos capturando conteúdo, vamos falar sobre o que devemos capturar. Esses são os quatro critérios que uso para decidir o que vale a pena economizar. Eu realmente procuro conteúdo que seja inspirador, útil, surpreendente ou pessoal.

Vejamos cada um deles primeiro. É algo que pode inspirá-lo no futuro? Você não pode Google Google um sentimento para aqueles momentos em que você precisa de um avanço. Você precisa de uma dose de motivação.

Você precisa de uma nova maneira de ver as coisas, uma nova perspectiva, que é muitas vezes com o trabalho criativo. Você precisa já ter coletado as citações, as lembranças, as imagens, os depoimentos que te inspiram a fazer o seu melhor trabalho. Não é hora de sair e encontrar essas coisas.

I personally keep a notebook full of customer testimonials. It's one of my favorite notebooks. Every time I feel like what I'm working on doesn't matter, that it's not good enough, that no one cares, all I have to do is look through that notebook and my perspective is completely shifted.

Starting in the 16th century in Europe, aristocrats and wealthy merchants kept what were called cabinets of curiosities, or wonder, common in German. What they would do is collect all sorts of specimens, from zoology to geology to ethnography to archaeology, religious or historical items, works of art, other antiquities into one room. It was a way of showing off their knowledge and their diverse interests.

And this was actually the precursor to modern museums. This is how museums started. And I think of my second brain as my own personal cabinet of curiosities, where I get to collect my own specimens and wander around anytime I need some inspiration.

The second criteria that I look for is, is this useful? This is kind of the opposite end of the spectrum from inspiring. Is this something just very practical that I could use to solve a problem in the future? Once you think of notes as knowledge building blocks, you realize that you can use blocks that others have created instead of making them all from scratch yourself, think like a scavenger rummaging through a junkyard, looking for spare parts to rip out and use for your own creations. If someone has figured out, say, how to embed an image on a web page, why not save those instructions so you can reference them later, instead of trying to solve that problem yourself every time you encounter it? If someone has defined a common term really well, or if they've figured out how to solve a thorny problem, or they found the perfect metaphor to explain something, borrow the results of their effort and just cite them as the source.

Growing up, my dad, who's an artist, would often rummage through the neighbor's trash in the middle of the day. No shame. He would just walk down the street, go through the trash bins in front of our neighbor's houses, because what he would often find is interesting.

Little items that people had thrown in the trash that he could use in his artwork. I remember one time he found a paint soaked glove. It was red paint, and it was completely mangled and maybe had some glue on it.

I mean, it was completely pointless and useless from a functional perspective. But he got that glove and he actually pasted it right onto one of his paintings as a metaphor for the subject of the painting. And it was really powerful and really unusual to have a physical item glued to a painting.

And at the time, as a kid, I was very embarrassed by that. But now I look back and I think, wow, he was able to get something that was common and actually useless and elevate it into something that was powerful and meaningful and actually useful from the point of view of communication and self expression. It's a great metaphor for what we can do as creative knowledge workers.

We can borrow even the lowly, most mundane things, the junk of the Internet, and repurpose it into something with a purpose. The third criteria is, is this surprising? Does it violate your expectations or go against your mental models? See, as we read or listen or talk to someone, our brain is actually predicting in real time what words will come next. If the words that we predict arrive, we kind of get bored.

We kind of just don't even really pay much attention. But if the words that we start to read violate that expectation, our brain kicks into overdrive to figure out why its predictions were incorrect. If you aren't surprised by something you learn, then at some level you already knew it, right? And if you already knew it, then why take note of it? The father of information theory, Claude Shannon, had the simplest possible definition of information that which surprises you.

Surprise is a good indicator. It's a good rule of thumb for when you should take notice something because it is a sign, it's a signal that a piece of information isn't already part of your mental model of the world. And the fourth criteria is it personal? Is this knowledge that you've gained through hard won personal experience? Reality is the most unforgiving teacher, and experience is the most expensive way to learn.

Think of the learnings from a project that was unexpectedly challenging or the learnings from past mistakes or failures that you've had, or advice given to you by friends or mentors. This is personal knowledge embedded in your life experience. It's not something you can just Google and find online.

Ask yourself, what are the stories you could preserve? Stories of things that happened to you or the people around you or to others. What are the experiences you want to document? The experiences that not everyone has had that taught you things? What insights can you save? Surprising revelations about how the world works and which memories are so precious that they're worth keeping. These are the kinds of content that are unique to you, that have been filtered through your own perspective and that no one else has access to.

This is where your second brain is like a journal or diary, a private place where you can examine your own thoughts. Except instead of writing in that journal, closing it and putting it on some shelf, you are entering it into a searchable network of ideas so that those insights can be found again. We have a tendency to have the same blind spots and get stuck in the same ruts over time.

It's amazing how much of the time we just need to see how we overcame this last time. Those are the four official capture criteria I recommend. But if you take away one thing from this lesson, it's this.

It's to capture what resonates resonance is an internal feeling of being moved or enlivened or excited by an idea you encounter. It's your intuition speaking, telling you that there is something special about what you're seeing. That is the same intuition you'll need when you sit down to write or get up to speak or strike out on any bold endeavor.

And you have the chance to train your ability to hear that intuitive resonance every single day through your notetaking. To make this very concrete, here are some of the most common kinds of content that people tend to save in their second brain. As I read these, picture what these look like in your own life.

What value, what interesting insights might be trapped in some of these everyday files and everyday documents. Think about highlights, passages and excerpts from things that you read ebooks articles, blog posts. Think about the huge volume of emails and other messages you send every day.

Are there excerpts of things you have said or other people have said that might be useful in the future. Think of photos of paper documents or scanned paper documents. Checklists and instructions, notes from courses, conferences or other programs that you've been a part of.

Think about your journal or diary entries personal revelations, personal reflections that you might want to keep meeting and conversation notes slides from presentations or talks transcripts of voice memos or other audio that you've recorded internet BOOKMARKS web pages that you've saved that you want to revisit photos or screenshots from your different devices. Social media posts, mind maps, diagrams or brainstorms, visual kinds of thinking that you've done, and drawings and sketches. There's such a variety of different kinds of content that we're surrounded with.

You don't need to keep it all, you just need to keep the five or 10% that is most timeless and valuable and unique. Applying the four criteria we just learned, can you see that the motivation for capturing something might vary quite a bit? Highlights from a nonfiction book that you read might be inspiring, but then a checklist is probably more on the you useful end of the spectrum. Meeting notes might contain something that a colleague said that were surprising.

But journal entries are probably more something personal. Even within a given note, you might save different excerpts for different reasons.
